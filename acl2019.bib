abstract="The GREYC Island team participated in the Structure Extraction Competition part of the INEX Book track for the first time, with the Resurgence software. We used a minimal strategy primarily based on top-down document representation. The main idea is to use a model describing relationships for elements in the document structure. Chapters are represented and implemented by frontiers between chapters. Page is also used. The periphery center relationship is calculated on the entire document and reflected on each page. The strong points of the approach are that it deals with the entire document; it handles books without ToCs, and titles that are not represented in the ToC (e. g. preface); it is not dependent on lexicon, hence tolerant to OCR errors and language independent; it is simple and fast.",
