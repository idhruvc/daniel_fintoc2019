Title detection and Table of Content (ToC) extraction are two important tasks for Natural Language Processing and Document Analysis, in particular in the context of digital libraries and scanned books.

We showed that simple stylometric features (frequency of punctuation, numbers and capitalized letters) combined with visual characteristics  (bold, italic\dots) achieve better results than the best character n-gram approach (1-4 grams).
Although this system did not achieved state-of-the-art performances, the results shows that simple and easy-to-compute features can provide very reliable results.

Regarding the ToC extraction ... \textbf{Ã  toi Emmanuel ?}
