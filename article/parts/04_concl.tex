% Regarding the title detection task we proposed some simple approaches that performed quite well.
We showed that very simple features can be of great interest, in particular in cases of training data scarcity.
 The methods we proposed can be improved in two different directions, regarding the features exploitation or exploring other features regarding the style of titles VS the style of non-titles. First, for improving a character-based approach it seems that LSTM architectures can be of great interest. The second option would be to extract syntactic patterns since sentence structures are quite different in titles.
